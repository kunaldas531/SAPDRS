Introduction
The Smart Accident Prevention, Detection, and Reporting System (SAPDRS) is a safety solution
designed to improve road safety. It prevents accidents through real-time monitoring, detects
incidents automatically, and reports them to emergency services or pre-defined contacts with critical
details like location.
Key Features
Accident Prevention: Warns about unsafe conditions like excessive speed or proximity to obstacles.
Accident Detection: Identifies crashes and impacts using advanced sensors.
Emergency Reporting: Automatically alerts emergency services and contacts with GPS location.
User-Friendly Interface: Displays status and alerts on a digital display.
Wireless Communication: Ensures quick and accurate reporting through SMS.
Components Overview
Safety Sensors: Measure proximity, speed, and driver condition.
Accident Detection Module: Detects collisions using accelerometers and other sensors.
Alert Module: Sends SMS alerts to emergency contacts via GSM technology.
Power Supply: Powers the system from the vehicle's battery.
Display Unit: Shows system status and alerts.
Installation and Setup
Step 1: Physical Installation
Mount sensors at designated points inside and outside the vehicle:
Proximity sensors on the front and rear bumpers.
Detection sensors securely inside the vehicle cabin.
Fix the main control module in a safe, accessible location.
Step 2: Power Supply
Connect the system to the vehicle's electrical system.
Ensure proper grounding to avoid malfunctions.
Step 3: Configuration
Use the system interface to input emergency contact numbers, set threshold values for alerts, and
enable location tracking.
Step 4: Testing
Test all modules to ensure functionality.
Operating Instructions
Starting the System
The system activates automatically when the vehicle starts.
A status indicator on the display confirms that the system is operational.
Accident Prevention
Proximity sensors monitor the surroundings and issue audio/visual alerts if hazards are detected.
Alerts for over-speeding or unsafe behavior are displayed and signaled.
Accident Detection and Reporting
Upon detecting an accident, the system sends SMS notifications to predefined contacts, including
location coordinates and severity details.
Maintenance and Troubleshooting
Routine Maintenance
Clean sensors regularly to remove dust and debris.
Check all connections periodically for wear and tear.
Ensure the system is securely mounted and not obstructed.
Troubleshooting
No Alerts Generated: Verify power supply connections and sensor functionality.
No SMS Sent: Ensure the SIM card has sufficient balance and proper signal strength.
Inconsistent Readings: Recalibrate the sensors.
Safety Guidelines
Ensure professional installation to avoid malfunctions.
Do not tamper with the system while the vehicle is in motion.
Regularly test the system to confirm proper functionality.
Replace damaged components immediately.
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Q: How does the system detect accidents?
A: The system uses impact sensors and accelerometers to measure sudden changes in motion or
force.
Q: Can I change the emergency contact numbers?
A: Yes, you can update them through the configuration settings.
Q: Does the system work without a mobile network?
A: The system requires a GSM network to send SMS alerts. Without network coverage, it will retry
until successful.
Q: Is the system compatible with all vehicles?
A: Yes, it can be installed in most vehicles with a standard power supply.
